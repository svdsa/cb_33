## Background Information

Ask a DSA member about “DSA National,” and, as with anything in DSA, you’ll get a variety of responses. Many in DSA simply don’t think about National—it has little to do with their local work. Some are frustrated with decisions being made. Some assume things will naturally improve once our “growing pains” subside. But DSA was never structured to be an organization of this size, with hundreds of locals in such disparate terrain. Currently, the 16-person NPC has a wide range of duties, from issuing political statements to overseeing finances to planning conventions. But the weakness of the NPC structure isn’t simply that there’s too much work for 16 people, but that decision- making power does not belong to the people most affected by those decisions.

As socialists we should be ambitious. We must develop radical democracy by practicing it.

This amendment restructures National to redistribute power to the locals. A new body, the Assembly of Locals, becomes the center for political decision-making, with representatives elected by each chapter, leaving the NPC (now simply called the Board) to focus on key fiduciary and administrative duties.

Our vision is of a national organization that’s not just “responsive” to membership but \*is\* membership. We hope to build democracy and develop leaders by giving members in every chapter the opportunity to get their hands dirty and create a more effective national organization.
